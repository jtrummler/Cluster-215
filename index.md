# Philadelphia Cluster Analysis

Different neighborhoods possess different characteristics that attract new residents to live in those places. Whether it’s the access or distance to amenities, demographic makeup, or affordability, many choices inform people’s desire to live in certain neighborhoods of a city. This web app is a cluster analysis of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania to help inform both current residents who may be looking to move within the city, as well as transplants looking to come to Philadelphia.

# Cluster Analysis

This section will show examples of embedding interactive charts produced using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) and [Hvplot](https://hvplot.pyviz.org/).

## Altair Example

Below is a chart of the incidence of measles since 1928 for the 50 US states.

<div id="altair-chart-1"></div>

This was produced using Altair and embedded in this static web page. Note that you can also display Python code on this page:

```python
import altair as alt
alt.renderers.enable('notebook')
```

## HvPlot Example

Lastly, the measles incidence produced using the HvPlot package:

<div id="hv-chart-1"></div>

## Notes

- See the [lecture 13A slides](https://musa-550-fall-2022.github.io/slideslecture-13A.html) for the code that produced these plots.

**Important: When embedding charts, you will likely need to adjust the width/height of the charts before embedding them in the page so they fit nicely when embedded.**

# Example: Embedding Folium charts

This post will show examples of embedding interactive maps produced using [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium).

## OSMnx and Street Networks

The shortest route between the Art Museum and the Liberty Bell:

<div id="folium-chart-1"></div>

## Percentage of Households without Internet

The percentage of households without internet by county:

<div id="folium-chart-2"></div>

See the [lecture 9B slides](https://musa-550-fall-2022.github.io/slides/lecture-9B.html) and the [lecture 10A slides](https://musa-550-fall-2022.github.io/slides/lecture-10A.html) for the code that produced these plots.
