# Cluster215

Welcome to Cluster215! This project looks at every neighborhood in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, and clusters them together based on shared characteristics. These characteristics come from built environment and demographic data aggregated from Open Data Philly, Open Street Map, and the American Community Survey. The technique used in this project is a k-means cluster analysis that developed five clusters of 158 Philadelphia neighborhoods. Check out my web app [here!](https://jtrummler.github.io/Cluster-215/)

This project was completed by Jack Rummler as a final project for MUSA 550 (Geospatial Data Science in Python) as a part of the Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics program at the University of Pennsylvania.
